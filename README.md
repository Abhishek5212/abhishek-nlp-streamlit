A restaurant review system is a web application that analyzes customer reviews of restaurants and generates insights to help restaurant owners improve their business. This system works by analyzing the text of reviews of customers, extracting relevant information.

The first step in building a restaurant review system using NLP is to collect dataset which is used from kaggle.

Next, the system uses NLP techniques like sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and entity recognition to extract insights from the reviews. Sentiment analysis is used to determine the overall sentiment of a review, whether it is positive, negative, or neutral. 

The insights generated by the restaurant review system can be used to help restaurant owners make informed decisions about their business. For example, if the system identifies that customers are complaining about the slow service, the restaurant owner can take steps to improve the speed of service. If the system identifies that customers are praising a particular dish, the restaurant owner can feature that dish more prominently on the menu.

In addition to helping restaurant owners improve their business, a restaurant review system using NLP can also benefit customers by providing them with more accurate and relevant information about restaurants. 

Overall, a restaurant review system using NLP is a powerful tool for analyzing customer feedback and generating insights to help restaurant owners improve their business and provide better service to their customers.
